LeNet Implementation with PyTorch
This repository contains an implementation of the LeNet architecture using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. LeNet, proposed by Yann LeCun et al. in 1998, is one of the pioneering convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and played a significant role in the advancement of deep learning.

Key Features
LeNet Architecture: The repository includes the implementation of the LeNet architecture, which comprises convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

MNIST Dataset: The model is trained and evaluated using the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision and deep learning.

Training Script: A training script is provided to train the LeNet model on the MNIST dataset. It includes data loading, model training, and evaluation steps.

Optimizer Selection: The implementation allows users to choose between different optimizers for training the model. By default, it uses the SGD optimizer, but it can be easily switched to other optimizers such as Adam or RMSProp.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.

Run the training script to train the LeNet model on the MNIST dataset.

Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test set and analyze the results.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for learning about convolutional neural networks, implementing classic neural network architectures like LeNet, and experimenting with different optimization techniques for training deep learning models. It provides a solid foundation for understanding and exploring the fundamentals of deep learning in the context of image classification tasks.
